# Pacify - A mental health awareness website

##Inspiration

Mental health refers to a person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; it influences what they feel and how they think, and behave.
An emotionally fit and stable person always feels vibrant and truly alive and can easily manage emotionally difficult situations. But in today's times,
mental sickness is becoming a growing issue..According to research conducted on adults, mental illness affects 19% of the adult population. Nearly one 
in every five children and adolescents on the globe has a mental illness. These alarming statistics reflect the wider prevalence of mental ill-health.
This makes poor mental health a global problem needed to be solve as soon as possible.
